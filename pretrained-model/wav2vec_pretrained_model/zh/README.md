# Wav2Vec2-Large-XLSR-53-Chinese-zh-cn-gpt

Fine-tuned [facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53) on Chinese (zh-CN) using the [Common Voice](https://huggingface.co/datasets/common_voice), included [Common Voice](https://huggingface.co/datasets/common_voice) Chinese (zh-TW) dataset (converting the label text to simplified Chinese). 
When using this model, make sure that your speech input is sampled at 16kHz.

## Usage

The model can be used directly (without a language model) as follows:

```python
import torch
import torchaudio
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForCTC, Wav2Vec2Processor

test_dataset = load_dataset("common_voice", "zh-CN", split="test")

processor = Wav2Vec2Processor.from_pretrained("ydshieh/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-chinese-zh-cn-gpt")
model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained("ydshieh/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-chinese-zh-cn-gpt")

resampler = torchaudio.transforms.Resample(48_000, 16_000)

# Preprocessing the datasets.
# We need to read the aduio files as arrays
def speech_file_to_array_fn(batch):
    speech_array, sampling_rate = torchaudio.load(batch["path"])
    batch["speech"] = resampler(speech_array).squeeze().numpy()
    return batch

test_dataset = test_dataset.map(speech_file_to_array_fn)
inputs = processor(test_dataset[:2]["speech"], sampling_rate=16_000, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)

with torch.no_grad():
    logits = model(inputs.input_values, attention_mask=inputs.attention_mask).logits

predicted_ids = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)

print("Prediction:", processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids))
print("Reference:", test_dataset[:2]["sentence"])
```


## Evaluation

The model can be evaluated as follows on the zh-CN test data of Common Voice.

## Training

The Common Voice zh-CN `train`, `validation` were used for training, as well as Common Voice zh-TW `train`, `validation` and `test` datasets.

The script used for training can be found [to be uploaded later](...)
